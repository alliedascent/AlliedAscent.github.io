To begin with, we are using a GoPro Hero video camera. These has been used in past years to success and we hope to find so as well. To begin with, we ran a room temp trial at full battery and found that it would run record for about 2 and a half hours regardless of settings. Ran a test at 1080p and 720p at 30fps and found similar results. As such, we will use a 1080p and 30fps setting during our launch. Understandably, the much colder environment at higher altitudes will affect the performance of the battery. This can be overcome in two ways, one is to use an enclosed area for the camera and use of a heating pad or one time use chemical exothermic device such as a simple hand warmer. Alternatively, a higher mAh external battery could be used and wired directly to the gopro. The stock battery is 1100 mAh, so take that into consideration. A 3500 mAh battery should provide plenty of longevity for the typical launch if you're interested in going that route.
